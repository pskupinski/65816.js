This project's goal is to fully emulate the 65816 microprocessor in JavaScript.

After achieving that goal the next step will be to create a new branch that will focus on emulating the SNES.  Any CPU related improvements that aren't specific to the SNES will be merged back.

You call the execute function of the cpu object with a raw hex string representing the program you wish to emulate and it will execute those instructions as close to the 65816 as possible.
