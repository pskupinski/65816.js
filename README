This project's goal is to fully emulate the 65816 microprocessor in JavaScript.

After achieving that goal the next step will be to create a new branch that will focus on emulating the SNES.  Any CPU related improvements that aren't specific to the SNES will be merged back.

Here is a short example of how to use the emulator:

var cpu = new CPU_65816();
cpu.load_binary("18fba9ff", 0x8000); // Load the program at 0x8000 in memory
cpu.execute(0x8000);                 // Execute starting at 0x8000
